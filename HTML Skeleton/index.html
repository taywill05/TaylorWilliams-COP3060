    <h1>Get to Know Taylor!</h1>
    <p>Hi! I am Taylor Williams a third year Honors Computer Science major from Fort Lauderdale, FL. I am the oldest of two and the only granddaughter on both sides of family. My younger brother is my best friend, and he is a freshman at FAMU this year. I grew up playing travel basketball from 5th grade to my senior year of high school. When first applying to FAMU, I was a Pre-PT major. After looking at the curriculum guide, I realized I did not like science enough to stay in that major. So, I switched to computer science. I initially wanted to do software development, but now I am leaning more towards data analytics. A fun fact about me is that I am a fourth generation Rattler! I am excited to learn new skills in web development this year! </p>
